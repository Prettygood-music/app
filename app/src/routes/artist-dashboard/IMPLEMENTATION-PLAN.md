## Technical Guidelines

### State Management
- Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) for component-level state
- Leverage `sveltekit-superforms` for form handling with Zod validation
- Use stores for cross-component state that needs to persist

### Component Structure
- Follow the established Atomic Design pattern:
  - `atoms/` - Basic UI elements
  - `molecules/` - Simple component combinations
  - `organisms/` - Complex UI sections
  - Pages are implemented in the route files

### Data Fetching
- Use SvelteKit's data loading patterns in `+page.ts` files
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Consider using stale-while-revalidate patterns for frequently changing data

### Styling
- Use TailwindCSS for component styling
- Leverage the shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible

### Testing
- Write unit tests for critical components
- Implement integration tests for pages
- Test with various data scenarios (empty state, loading, error, filled)

## Milestones and Dependencies

1. **Foundation** (Tasks 1-2)
   - Dashboard layout and navigation must be completed first
   - Overview page provides the template for other dashboard sections

2. **Data Layer** (Tasks 3-4)
   - Data services and visualization components can be developed in parallel
   - These are prerequisites for connecting to real data

3. **Integration** (Tasks 5-7)
   - Real data connection depends on data services being complete
   - Wallet integration and content management can be developed independently

4. **Completion** (Task 8)
   - NFT placeholder can be implemented at any time, independent of other tasks

## Estimated Effort

| Task Group | Estimated Effort (days) | Status |
|------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Layout & Navigation | 2-3 | 🟢 Completed |
| Overview Page | 2-3 | 🟢 Completed |
| Data Services | 3-4 | 🟡 In Progress (1/4 completed) |
| Visualization Components | 4-5 | 🟡 In Progress (2/4 completed) |
| Real Data Connection | 3-4 | 🟢 Completed |
| Wallet Integration | 3-4 | 🟡 In Progress (3/4 completed) |
| Content Management | 4-6 | 🟡 In Progress (3/4 completed) |
| NFT Placeholder | 1 | 🟢 Completed |
| **Total** | **22-30** |
