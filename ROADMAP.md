   - Test offline functionality across various network conditions

## Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication & Security (Highest Priority)**
   - Complete wallet-based authentication flow with proper security
   - ~~Implement secure JWT handling in frontend~~ (Completed: Added robust token refresh system)
   - ~~Create robust error handling for authentication failures~~ (Completed: Added multi-tier fallback system for token handling)
   - Implement proper permission checks throughout the application
   - Test security with various edge cases

2. **Type Safety**
   - Continue using generated TypeScript types for database models
   - Maintain strict typing between database and API layers
   - Keep types up-to-date with database schema changes
   - Ensure proper typing for service worker and PWA components

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement data caching strategy for API responses
   - Add code splitting for route-based bundle optimization
   - Optimize image loading with proper sizing and formats
   - Consider server-side rendering for critical routes
   - Improve initial load time metrics

4. **State Management**
   - Continue leveraging Svelte 5 runes for component-level state
   - Implement global auth state management
   - Use proper loading and error states for API data
   - Ensure offline state is properly tracked and managed

5. **Testing Strategy**
