   - Add loading states to UI during data fetching
   - Test performance with larger datasets

2. **Begin Authentication Flow Implementation**
   - Start implementing the Sui wallet integration in the frontend
   - Create wallet connection component
   - Implement message signing for authentication
   - Set up JWT token handling

3. **Connect UI to Real APIs**

## Technical Considerations

1. **Type Safety**
   - Continue using generated TypeScript types for database models
   - Ensure consistent typing between database and API layers
   - Keep types up-to-date with database schema changes

2. **Docker Development Environment**
   - Use Docker for consistent development environments
   - Run database services in Docker containers
   - Leverage PostgREST for API access to the database

3. **State Management**
   - Continue using Svelte 5 runes for component-level state
   - Use proper loading and error states for API data
   - Implement caching strategy for API responses

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create comprehensive end-to-end tests for critical flows
   - Test edge cases in the player functionality
   - Plan blockchain integration tests
   - Test performance with realistic data volumes

5. **Audio Optimization**
   - Plan gapless playback implementation
   - Design audio loading optimizations
   - Consider error handling for playback issues

6. **Blockchain Integration Strategy**
   - Keep blockchain interactions focused on essential features (wallet auth, tipping)
   - Plan for clear user feedback during blockchain operations
   - Design fallbacks for when blockchain operations fail

7. **Progressive Web App Implementation**
   - Plan service worker strategy for offline capabilities
   - Design app manifest for installation
   - Consider caching strategies for audio content
