# Additional Migration Fixes

This document describes additional fixes implemented to resolve issues with database migrations and seed files.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. References to non-existent 'collaborative' column

**Problem:** Migration 010 referenced a `collaborative` column in the playlists table that doesn't exist.

**Fix:** Removed references to the `collaborative` column in the RLS policy definitions in `010_create_rls_policies.sql`. Simplified the check to only look at user ownership or collaborator status.

### 2. Issues with context columns in play_history

**Problem:** Migration 012 was trying to create indexes and comments on `context_id` and `context_type` columns that might not exist yet.

**Fix:** Modified `012_create_play_history.sql` to check if these columns exist before trying to create indexes or add comments on them using conditional logic in PL/pgSQL blocks.

### 3. Database reference issue in schema setup

**Problem:** Migration 001 was trying to alter a database named "CURRENT" which doesn't exist.

**Fix:** Updated `001_create_schemas.sql` to use dynamic SQL to retrieve the actual current database name using `current_database()` function instead of using the keyword "CURRENT".

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Dynamic SQL for Flexibility**: Used dynamic SQL in DO blocks to adapt to different database environments.

2. **Column Existence Checks**: Added explicit checks for column existence before attempting operations on them.

3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to make migrations more resilient.

4. **Database Independence**: Made migrations work regardless of the actual database name.

## Testing

These fixes have been applied to address specific error messages encountered during migration. The modified migrations should now:

1. Successfully create the required tables and indexes
2. Apply RLS policies without errors
3. Configure the database search path correctly
4. Handle missing columns gracefully

## Recommendation

After applying these fixes, it's recommended to:

1. Run a full migration test in a clean environment to verify all issues are resolved
2. Consider adding pre-migration validation scripts to check for potential issues before running migrations
3. Implement a more structured dependency system to manage migration order
4. Add detailed logging to help debug any future migration issues
