# Schema Migration: prettygood â†’ public

This document describes the migration from the custom `prettygood` schema to the standard Supabase `public` schema.

## Changes Made

1. **Schema References**: All references to `prettygood` schema have been changed to `public` schema:
   - Table definitions
   - Function definitions
   - Trigger definitions
   - Comments and documentation
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Policy definitions

2. **Function Locations**: All functions are now defined in the `public` schema:
   - `set_updated_at()` 
   - All business logic functions
   - All utility functions

3. **Tables**: All tables have been moved to the `public` schema

## Benefits of Using the `public` Schema

Using the `public` schema in Supabase has several advantages:

1. **Supabase Default**: Supabase is designed to work with the `public` schema by default. Most examples, documentation, and tools assume this schema is used.

2. **Simpler Queries**: The `public` schema is implicitly part of the search path, which means you don't need to qualify table references with the schema name in many contexts.

3. **API Integration**: The Supabase client libraries and API endpoints are configured to work with tables in the `public` schema automatically.

4. **PostgREST Configuration**: PostgREST (which powers Supabase's RESTful API) is pre-configured to expose tables in the `public` schema.

5. **Row Level Security**: RLS is the recommended way to secure data in Supabase, regardless of schema. Moving to `public` schema emphasizes RLS as the security mechanism.

6. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler schema design reduces cognitive overhead and makes the database more maintainable.

7. **Migration Compatibility**: Database migrations are more straightforward with the standard schema.

## Security Considerations

Security is maintained through Row Level Security (RLS) policies, which are schema-agnostic. The migration to the `public` schema does not reduce security because:

- All tables still have RLS enabled
- All policies have been preserved with the same access logic
- User authentication and authorization checks remain unchanged
- Sensitive data remains protected by appropriate policies

## Implementation Notes

- This change is a simple rename of the schema prefix and doesn't change any business logic
- No data migration is required since this is purely a schema change
- All database functions maintain the same behavior and signatures
- All policies maintain the same security rules

## Testing

After deploying this change, please verify:

1. All API endpoints work as expected
2. User permissions remain properly enforced
3. Database functions return the expected results
4. Foreign key constraints are properly enforced
5. Triggers fire correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, we can revert to the `prettygood` schema by:

1. Restoring the previous schema files from version control
2. Re-running the migration to recreate the `prettygood` schema structure
