# Schema Architecture Changes

## Summary of Changes

We've migrated away from using a separate `prettygood_private` schema to a single `prettygood` schema with Row Level Security (RLS) policies. This change:

1. Simplifies the database architecture
2. Aligns with Supabase best practices
3. Resolves the "prettygood_private does not exist" errors
4. Maintains proper security through RLS

## What Changed

### Moved from Private Schema to Main Schema
- **Tables**: `payment_status_history` and `related_genres` moved to the `prettygood` schema
- **Functions**: `set_updated_at()` and `track_payment_status_changes()` moved to the `prettygood` schema
- **Triggers**: All triggers updated to reference functions in the new location

### Added RLS Policies
- **payment_status_history**: Only admins and artists can access their own payment history
- **related_genres**: Only admins can manage genre relationships

## Applying the Changes

1. The migration file `20250421200000_move_from_private_schema.sql` handles all necessary changes
2. Core schema files have been updated to reflect the new architecture
3. Data will be copied from the old schema if it exists

To apply these changes:

```bash
supabase db push
```

## Supabase Best Practices

This refactoring follows these Supabase best practices:

1. **Use a simple schema structure**:
   - Keep tables in a single schema when possible
   - Avoid cross-schema references which can be error-prone

2. **Leverage RLS for security**:
   - Control access via RLS policies rather than schema separation
   - Define granular policies for read/write access

3. **Use security definer functions when needed**:
   - Functions that need elevated privileges are marked as `SECURITY DEFINER`
   - This allows controlled access to protected operations

4. **Clear policy definitions**:
   - Each table has explicit policies defining who can access it
   - Policies are aligned with business rules (admin access, own data access)

## Final Notes

After confirming that the application works correctly with these changes, you can safely drop the old schema:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS prettygood_private CASCADE;
```

This should be done in a separate migration after thorough testing.
